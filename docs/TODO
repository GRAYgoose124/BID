# TODO: Add BF tutorial, design this to give a good understanding of program structure and interpreter workings....
# TODO: Make it show the parts of the python code being utilized in interpreter?(Output interpreter source as you debug)
# TODO: Breakpoints should be visible!
# TODO: Time Taken
# TODO: Display filename loaded
# TODO: Init all interpreter variables in __init__???
# TODO: Show position on input string
# TODO: Should I allow live source editing?
# TODO: Disable all debug buttons in one function and have a reenable function reenable all buttons
# ...There are a lot of repetitions in different code blocks, functionalize this.
# TODO: Modify to toggle unbounded, bounded, no wrap, wrap, EOF, etc wrap cells etc Have a new command like # to ...
# ... denote all this so individual programs can specify their needs.
# TODO: When no source is loaded or edited, just disable all buttons for running etc...These should all be the ones ...
# ... which have grouped enable/disable functions.
# TODO: Tape to deque if keeping infinite tape...
# TODO: Syntax Errors! Match [] before execution (I.e set up jumps at start and read from dict key: value ]pos: [pos)
# TODO: Runtime Errors! Trying to < or > at end of tape if bounded.
# TODO: Running In progress display and Run after debug to continue the process and finish
# TODO: Compile brainfuck for running.
# TODO: When debugging, if you click run it should finish the program normally.
