# Brainfuck Interactive Developer
   BID is an IDE for [brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) designed to aid in learning about debugging and 
interpreter operation.

Brainfuck is a great language to learn about these topics. It is easy to understand because of its minimal form, but it
lays a solid foundation for understanding how an interpreter works. It's possible to use it to do the same with 
debugging and compilation.

This program is meant to be an all-in-one learning environment, including tutorials and practice.

## Running
BID requires `Python 3.5+` to run correctly and BID currently depends on `tkinter`.


## Current Features
* Input/Source editing, loading, and saving
* Debugger forward/backward stepping and variable speed auto-stepping
* Rudimentary tape and state visualization


## Planned Features
* Visualization of the interpreter running
* Compilation to Python and C (Including optimizations)
* Tutorial Interface and step-by-step guide (BF Examples included)
* Debugging features including breakpoints
* Add custom BF commands
* Variable BF Interpreter support


## FAQ and Concerns
* The name is offensive!

Learning is learning, don't be petty!
